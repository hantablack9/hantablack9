- 👋 Hi, I’m @hantablack9
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the power and potential of data analytics and data science in the field of Climate and Gender Economics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the tools for data analysis like R, Tableu and Python and plan on eventually progressing into regression, data modelling and machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects in the domains of public and economic policy currently, but I'm open to exploring beyond these confines.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can email me on cipherxhan@gmail.com
